# Bogosort
[Bogosort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort) is a simple and stupid algorithm to sort an array.  
I had to do this algorithm in an interview once, i found the whole idea of bogosort very funny and wanted to make a single file which is as long as possible, but still readable and this is the result. Everything is made from the ground up.   


Linux builds do not include a single library, they use syscalls directly from assembly to print to stdout.  
Other builds only include 'cstdio' for printf.
